## Challenge Name
**AutoEval Challenge**

## Challenge Description
The goal of the AutoEval Challenge is to develop a system capable of detecting handwritten true/false answers from scanned student PDF documents and calculating the corresponding scores automatically. This challenge requires the application of computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms to accurately interpret handwritten responses and evaluate them.

## Repository Overview
This repository contains all the necessary files to reproduce our solution for the AutoEval Challenge. The main components of our solution include:

- **Jupyter Notebook (`AutoEval_Challenge_Solution.ipynb`)**: A well-documented notebook that walks through the entire process of our solution, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **split.py**: A file while splits the images based on image mapping in different folders.
- **join.py**: A file while joins the csv output files.
## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- flash_attn
- Transformers
- PyTorch
- Pandas
